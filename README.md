> A data structure is a way to store and organise data in a computer, so that is can be used efficiently.

We talk about data-structures as:

1. Mathematical/logical models or abstract data types
1. Implementation

List ----- _abstract data type_

- Store a given number of elements
- Read elements by position
- Modify element at a position

Arrays ----- _concrete implementation_

- Linked list

#### Abstract data type

> Define data and operations, but no implementation.

#### Concrete implementation

> - Arrays
> - Linked List
> - Stack
> - Queue
> - Tree
> - Graph
> - ...

#### Content

> 1. Logical view
> 2. Operations
> 3. Cost of operations
> 4. Implementation
